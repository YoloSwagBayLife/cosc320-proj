- Converted program from C++ to C
- Added support for writing arrays to files, improved array generation
- Began working on threading

------MAJOR CHANGES IN EACH FILE------
main:
  began implementing threads but ran into compilation issue
deSort.h:
  added dummy functions to test threads
arr.h:
  printArr(int* arr) now used mostly for debugging since writing arrays to files
  writeArr(int* arr, char* file) will write array [passed as arr] to file [passed as file]
  added status lines to be printed to stdout
  shuffle(int* arr) will randomize array
  
NOTES: array is generated in DESCENDING order and sorted into ASCENDING order
      (this is to illustrate that array was both randomized and sorted)
      
      shuffle() has a for loop which runs MANY, MANY times [is it enough? too much?]
       
PLAN:
  -fix current compilation issue
  -implement parallel computing:
    2 threads(thr1, thr2)
    first searches first half of array, tracks index of high and low values
    then signals for second thread to do the same
    threads then pipe values to one another (thr1 sends high to thr2, thr2 sends low to thr1)
    use piped info as needed
    make swap
    repeat until sorted
