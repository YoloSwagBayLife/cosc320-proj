  -implement parallel computing:
    2 threads(thr1, thr2)
    first searches first half of array, tracks index of high and low values
    then signals for second thread to do the same
    threads then pipe values to one another (thr1 sends high to thr2, thr2 sends low to thr1)
    use piped info as needed
    make swap
    repeat until sorted
